    <!-- Hello! I am Damla. I have been learning web development technologies for a month. 
I have had challenges, I know this will go on but I will keep trying so hard. I made a few projects about HTML. 
However, in this project, I am going to create something new and good about HTML and CSS. 
I am using more than one tutorial but in this project, I mostly focus on Jonas Schdetmann's Udemy course. 
I hope I can create a useful project. Good luck to me. I hope you enjoy my project.:)  -->

      <p>
        I am <em>Damla Buse AÄŸaÃ§diken</em>. I live in Mersin, TÃ¼rkiye. I am 24
        years old, I am married, and I have two cats.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this webpage, I am going to talk about my software development
        journey.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Software Development?</h3>
      <p>
        I am a linguistics student. However, I realized that I did not like
        enough my field. I have always been interested in technology.
        <br />
        For 2-3 years AI has looked very interesting to me.I have been
        researching software nearly for 2 years and I recently made a choice
        between linguistics and software.
        <br />
        The winner is software. :)
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><strong>I have 3 main motivation;</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Loving technology</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Chance of working remote</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Don't love my current field</em>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">
        Note: I have also a robotics company that makes solar panel cleaning
        robots.
        <a href="https://robegrobotik.com/" target="_blank">

      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>What Are My Aims About Software?</h3>

      <p>
        I have lots of aims about software development. However, these will be
        my first steps;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Learning frameworks about front-end </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Being a front-end developer!(I know this not that much easyðŸ˜ƒ)</em
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>That is enough for now! I hope, I will see you in my next project:)</p>
